# Aim of Project: Nutritious Bot

[Nutritious Bot](https://minirazs.github.io/project2_ai_nutrition/)ðŸ¤–is an informative and straighforward site to find out food nutrition and related recipes.

## UX

The aim of the site is for the user to have a refreshing experience in understanding the nutritional values of a food dish and to view related recipes by introducing an _AI-powered Image Recognition API_ for an image-based search to enhance the search process, besides having a text-based search. The common ways of finding recipes online or via the apps are usually text-based searches.

## UI

_Colour_

The main colours used in the site are 3 shades of green, black, and white. Green is chosen as it is closely associated with greens and vegetables, healthy food.

_Font_

Thasadith is a minimalistic, modern font that gives off a simple, clean feel.

_Wireframe_

The wireframe (.pdf) is in the [wireframe folder](https://github.com/Minirazs/project2_ai_nutrition/blob/master/wireframe/wireframe.pdf). The idea is to create a simple 1 pager with clear and enticing content to allow the user to navigate the site easily.

1. The top section of the site is denoted by the background image of healthy dishes with a focus on the accordion holding 3 search bars.
2. The middle section of the site has a plain white background to display the search results prominently.
3. The footer of the site has a link to my Github and a scroll-up button for the user to quickly get back to the top of the site to access the search bars.

## User Stories

- The user wants to find out the nutritional facts of a particular dish and receives similar recipes to make it.
- The user wants to know if the recipe recommended from each search is considered healthy or unhealthy, based on its health score.
- There may be scenarios where the user comes across a new dish when he is eating out and he takes a photograph of the dish, wanting to see if he can make something similar afterwards. In this case, the user can upload the new dish image on the site to find out its nutritional values and the recipes.
- The user can also paste an image URL of a dish he sees online to search for its nutrition and recipes.
- The user can quickly search by typing on the name of the dish if he does not want to explore the image-based searches.

## Features

- The first search bar, &#39;_Image Analyser&#39;_ that uses AI-powered Image Recognition API, makes recipe discovery easier by enabling users to search by uploading an image from their device. Currently, there are only 50 food dishes that the API can recognize.
- The second search bar, &#39;_Image URL Analyser&#39;_ that also uses an Image Recognition API, makes recipe discovery easier by enabling users to search by uploading an image URL from the web.
- The third search bar, &#39;_Search by Text&#39;_, is a text-based search process that allows the users to access to one of the widest range of recipe database in the world (350k+)
- Nutritional values of the search item will be displayed first followed by a list of recipes.
- Showing a list of similar recipes with links to an external page that contains extensive information on every recipe that includes nutritional facts, ingredients, and directions.
- Every recipe presented is assigned a health score. 100 for a perfect health score and 0 for the worst score. The higher the score is measured by how easily the dish can be made, whether the nutritional values are healthy intakes for the body, and how affordable are the ingredients.
- All the links and images â€“ when hovered over, the links appear in dark blue. When the cursor is stopped and hovered over the object for a few seconds, text (in the title) appears to describe it.
- Scroll-up button â€“ once clicked, the site will bring the user back to the top of the page.
- Mobile responsive â€“ when device and screen size changes, the elements in the site change to optimize the user&#39;s viewing experience.

### _Features that can be improved / Future Plans_

- To provide demo images for the Image Analyser search bar (1st bar) and to show a preview of the image uploaded.
- The project can be expanded to improve user functionality by having user accounts, allowing every user to input personal details and track his calorie intake and nutritional intake, and save recipes.

  - Used to validate Javascript codes and the results are ignored as they do not affect the functionality of the site: &#39;let&#39;/&#39;const&#39; is available in ES6 (use &#39;esversion: 6&#39;) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz); &#39;template literal syntax&#39; is only available in ES6 (use &#39;esversion: 6&#39;); &#39;Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. ($, searchTerms, resultLength)&#39;

## Testing

The initial testing phase was to put the HTML code, CSS code, and Javascript code through the W3C, Jigsaw, and JSHint validator tools to check and rectify issues.

Next, using the browser&#39;s Inspect tool and Live Server extension on VSC to preview the site ensures that the site is mobile responsive and all content, such as video banner, buttons, and links, is correctly and displayed on different screen sizes, namely mobile (below 480px), tablet (between 768px to 1024px) and laptop (above 1024px):

- iPad (portrait and landscape mode)
- iPad Pro (portrait and landscape mode)
- Kindle Fire (portrait and landscape mode)
- Galaxy S9/S9+
- iPhone X/XS
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 5/SE
- Pixel 2
- Moto G4
- Surface Duo
- Galaxy Fold

These steps are repeated in the testing on three major web browsers, Chrome, IE Edge, and Firefox:

1. Manually pressing and testing external links (e.g. the title and image of each recipe card) open a new tab and lead to the correct destination.
2. The internal hyperlink leads to the correct section of the site, specifically referring to the scroll-up button and the reference to the 3rd search bar
3. Submitting requests using different images, image URLs, and dish names to test the response of the APIs and validate the results. All requests produce an output of a certain type of recipe.
  1. For the first two search bars (image analyser and URL analyser), there are only 50 food dishes for the time being that can be analysed accurately. For an image that falls out of the 50 dishes, the API will return the closest recipe.
  2. If the user is not satisfied with the results from the first 2 search bars, he can type in the 3rd search bar (search by text) that has a much larger recipe database of 350,000, and that will give a more accurate search result.
